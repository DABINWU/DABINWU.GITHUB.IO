        <h2>On the nature of love</h2>
        <p>The night is black and the forest has no end;
            a million people thread it in a million ways.
            We have trysts to keep in the darkness, but where
            or with whom - of that we are unaware.
            But we have this faith - that a lifetime's bliss
            will appear any minute, with a smile upon its lips.
            Scents, touches, sounds, snatches of songs
            brush us, pass us, give us delightful shocks.
            Then peradventure there's a flash of lightning:</p>
